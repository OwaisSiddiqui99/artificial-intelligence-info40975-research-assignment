Abstract:

This project implements a binary classification model for the Chess End-Game dataset (King-Rook vs. King-Pawn on a7). The dataset contains 3196 chess board positions with 36 categorical features describing the board state. Using PyCaret for 16 different classification algorithms were compared to predict whether White can win ('won') or cannot win ('nowin'). The best performing model was the Decision Tree Classifier achieving performance with 99.46% accuracy during cross-validation and 98.96% accuracy on the test set. The model also achieved an AUC of 0.9948.
